# SOCIAL LINKS PROFILE 🌐📱📸

Welcome to the SOCIAL LINKS PROFILE Challenge! This repository contains a solution for the Frontend Mentor challenge, where I built a page with my social links using only HTML and CSS. The project demonstrates responsiveness and the application of various design concepts.

## Project Structure 📂

- **`assets/`**: Contains all static assets for the project.

  - **`images/`**: Houses the favicon and the main banner image used in the HTML document.
  - **`fonts/`**: Contains files needed to import the Outfit and Young-Serif fonts locally.

- **`design/`**: Holds preview images of the mobile and desktop layouts, which served as references during development.

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file for the recipe page.

- **`style-guide.md`**: Provides the style guides and design principles used to aid in the coding process.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the recipe page.
- **CSS**: For styling and ensuring the page's responsiveness.
- **Grid Layout**: For position elements on the screen in a clean and organized way
